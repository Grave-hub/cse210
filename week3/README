The game is Seeker (not from Harry Potter)

The hider's location is a random number between 1 and 1000.
The seeker searches for the hider by guessing its location.
If the guess is closer to the hider's location it says, "Getting warmer!"
If the guess is farther away from the hider's location it says, "Getting colder!"
If the guess is correct the hider says, "You found me!". The game is over.
